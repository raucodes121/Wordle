## ðŸŽ® The Wordle Addiction: From Player to Creator

We all remember those Wordle addiction days, right? The thrill of guessing that elusive five-letter word, the bittersweet moments when you missed it by a single letter, and the pure joy when you finally cracked the code. Wordle swept the world by storm, and we couldn't get enough of it.

So, what did I do? I decided to dive headfirst into the obsession and bring it to life in my very own way. This project is a labor of love for all the Wordle enthusiasts out there. It's not just a game; it's a tribute to the countless hours we've spent glued to our screens, passionately trying to conquer the world of letters.

## How to Play

The rules of Wordle are straightforward:

1. You have six attempts to guess a five-letter word.
2. After each guess, you'll receive feedback on your word:
   - Letters that are in the target word but in the wrong position will be highlighted in a different color.
   - Letters that are in the target word and in the correct position will be highlighted differently.
   - Letters that are not in the target word will remain unchanged.
3. Your goal is to guess the word in as few attempts as possible.

## Game Phases

This Wordle game project went through two phases:

### Phase 1: Initial Version
In the initial version, the game did not feature a keyboard for input. Players had to manually type their guesses into a text input field.

### Phase 2: Keyboard Integration
As the project evolved, a keyboard feature was added, making it more user-friendly. Players could click on virtual keys to input their guesses, enhancing the overall gaming experience.

## Features

- Interactive and user-friendly interface.
- Feedback system to help you make educated guesses.
- Fun and challenging word-puzzle experience.
